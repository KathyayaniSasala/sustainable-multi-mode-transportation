# Sustainable Multi-Mode Transportation 🌍

**A web application that helps users choose eco-friendly transport options based on carbon emissions and calories burned.**

---

## 🧾 Abstract

Sustainable multi-mode transportation is a web application that shows the carbon emissions of different modes of transport and provides results to users based on the lowest carbon outflow and calories burned. Based on the user's input `To` and `From` locations, the system will:

- Display available routes and transport modes (Driving, Walking, Bicycle, Transit)
- Highlight the **best option with the least carbon footprint**
- Provide **estimated emissions**, **travel time**, and **distance**
- Include **weather updates** to help users plan accordingly

> All calculations are based on public GHG (greenhouse gas) data. Public transport options include buses, trains, and others when applicable.
